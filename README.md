# coqrep

This is a repository containing what I have done so far to formalize results from computable analysis in coq. Keep in mind that I am fairly new to coq. So if something else is strange it is probably because I don't know better and you should tell me.
The notations heavily use natural language in attempt to make it possible to read lemmas and statements out loud. To avoid blocking too many keywords, left recursive notations that use natural language start in a "\".
