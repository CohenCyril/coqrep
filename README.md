# coqrep

This is a repository containing what I have done so far to formalize results from computable analysis in coq. Keep in mind:
- I am working in Windows and haven't figured out how to compile stuff yet. I am aware that using Load is not good, but for now I use it due to the lack of a better option.
- I am new to coq. So if something else is strange it is probably because I don't know better and you should tell me.
- I am not sure about how to proceed best and I keep finding out new stuff about coq every day. I do not attempt to stay consistent but experiment with different approaches in different files. This may make stuff hard to read. I am trying to have a good documentation by adding comments that explain stuff, though.
- Also I am not sure how to formulate stuffs, so there is a lot of redundancies where I try different approaches in different files. Feel free to comment.
